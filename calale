I've been thrown to the river
going down, going down
I was born a believer
and I can't change that
beam of light trough my soul
piece of lead trough my heart
now I'm dead by the river
little late for changing that

I've been thrown to the river
going down, going down
I was born a believer
and I can't change that
beam of light trough my soul
piece of lead trough my heart
now I'm dead by the river
little late for changing that
little late for changing that

I've got a debt on my back
and I just checked on my pocket
it's almost empty,
I was supposed to be rich
successful married and kids
when I was twenty three,
And I remember my popa
saying hold on your horses
life ain't easy,
I didn't knew till I grew
and now I know that it's true,
Yeah life ain't easy.

Since I was born a felt the way
And I didn't have much to say
We took our things head on our way
We didn't even say
We didn't even say goodbye.
